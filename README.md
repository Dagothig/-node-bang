# node-bang
Node server for playing Bang! games.

Installation should be relatively straightforward: npm install and gulp (assuming it is installed) should do the trick.

This is based on the rules and cards of the vanilla game; so there are no extra cards or characters present only in the expansions (if there are, then it's a bug).

A version of the game is currently up on [my ever-so-dubious website](http://bang.dagothig.com/).

As of now the game is fully implemented and supports disconnects and things of the such; however it's missing a few things, namely a sane client (current one's just a visualisation of the json tree), a results phase after playing and lots and lots of bug testing. Probably a third rewrite of the whole system as well (if you dare, go read the game folder).
