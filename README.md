# node-bang
Node server for playing Bang! games.

Installation should be relatively straightforward: npm install and gulp (assuming it is installed) should do the trick.

This is based on the rules and cards of the vanilla game; so there are no extra cards or characters present only in the expansions (if there are, then it's a bug).
